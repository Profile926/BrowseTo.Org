# TV Viewer Usages
The TV Viewer main page is [here](https://github.com/Profile926/BrowseTo.Org/blob/main/README.md).

On this page I like to keep track of the different usages that TV Viewer can be used for.

Watch TV on a computer monitor  
Play computer games (PlayStation 2) on a monitor  
Use a webcam as a full screen mirror and check make-up ;)  
Use a netbook as a storage server, and use the display to show the TV-out of an amplifier (change settings, internet radio, etc.)

####Customer Testimonials  
I just purchased the TV-Viewer for monitoring an experiment with a videocamera (using Pinnacle Movie Box DV) on the same laptop on which the data acquisition software runs. It worked perfectly well. Then checked my camcorder via firewire. I got the same good results using the laptop as TV. Both audio and video were immediately available. I really was surprised.  
A great tool for a very reasonable price! Thanks for your work.
