# TV Viewer Usages
The TV Viewer main page is [here](https://github.com/Profile926/BrowseTo.Org/blob/main/README.md).

On this page I like to keep track of the different usages that TV Viewer can be used for. Would you like to share yours? Mail me (and if possible, send pictures)!

Watch TV on a computer monitor  
Play computer games (PlayStation 2) on a monitor  
Use a webcam as a full screen mirror and check make-up ;)  
Use a netbook as a storage server, and use the display to show the TV-out of an amplifier (change settings, internet radio, etc.)

Customer Testimonials  
I just purchased the TV-Viewer for monitoring an experiment with a videocamera (using Pinnacle Movie Box DV) on the same laptop on which the data acquisition software runs . It worked perfectly well. Then checked my camcorder via firewire. I got the same good results using the laptop as TV. Both audio and video were immediately available. I really was surprised.  
A great tool for a very reasonable price! Thanks for your work.
